### The Problem
In the languages listed below, take the .csv file in the data/ directory and productionize a webservice to read in the CSV file and output it in JSON.  Furthermore, once the data is in a JSON format, present the data in a creative way to the end-user.  

#### Back-end focused Engineer
- In the language of your choice from the above mentioned languages, take the provided CSV and productionize a service.

#### Front-end focused Engineer
- Present data from the CSV in a usable form to a user

### Extra Credit
